**Fixed Income Portfolio Optimizer **


When looking for portfolio optimizers, I have often found they are more readily available for equity investing than for fixed income investing. As a result, I have created a basic fixed income portfolio optimizer that maximizes portfolio yield while holding duration, convexity, and credit rating at a given target. This optimizer can be easily varied to meet other criteria such as total par value, KRD, etc using a tradable universe of bonds as an input. It can also be used to minimize certain targets, for example, to make a fixed income portfolio more capital efficient.
